# Problem: 101. Symmetric Tree

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

```go
   1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

```go
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```
